            <p> Need for Speed: Most Wanted is a 2005 open-world racing video game, and the ninth installment in the Need for Speed series.
                Developed by EA Canada and EA Black Box and published by Electronic Arts, it was released in November 2005 for PlayStation 2, Xbox,
                GameCube, Nintendo DS, Microsoft Windows, Game Boy Advance and Xbox 360. An additional version, Need for Speed: Most Wanted 5-1-0,
                was released in the same year for PlayStation Portable. The game focuses on street racing-oriented gameplay involving a selection of events and racing circuits
                found within the fictional city of Rockport, with the game's main story involving players taking on the role of a street racer who must compete against 15 of the city's
                most elite street racers to become the most wanted racer of the group, in the process seeking revenge against one of the groups who took their car and developing a
                feud with the city's police department.

                    Most Wanted brought in many notable improvements and additions over other entries in the series, its major highlight being more in-depth police pursuits.
                    Certain editions of the game were packaged with the ability for online multiplayer gaming.
                    Upon its release, the game received acclaim from critics and became a huge commercial success, selling 16 million copies worldwide,
                    becoming one of the best entries in the series as a result. Its success led to a collector's edition, Black Edition, which provided
                    additional content for the game.
